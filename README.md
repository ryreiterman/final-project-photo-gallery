## Title
Ryan's Super Cool Photo Galleries

## Description 
I've been an avid photographer for more than 10 years, and I've always wanted to build a website where I could display some of my favorite pictures all in one place and easily share the galleries with family. This is a project I had in mind before I started this bootcamp, and after six months of learning full-stack development it feels great to have it done.

## Demo

## Technologies Used

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSX, React, Node.js, Heroku

* [Big Poppa React Starter Code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/big-poppa-code-react-starter)

* [React Carousel Image Gallery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-gallery)

* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)

## Other Helpful Links

* [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

* [Cloudinary documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation)

* [CSS Tricks guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

* [Frontend Masters React course](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/react/)

* [W3 Schools image hover overlay tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp)

* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

## Key Things I Learned 

* Gained a deeper understanding of React, specifically when and how to use useEffect

* It's not always fun to spend an hour or two reading documentation, but it can save you hours and hours of frustration

* Know when (and how) to make API calls on the frontend and backend

* NPM packages can save a lot of time and really enhance a project

* Fetching, accessing and customizing JSON data

## What Needs Improvement

* Hard coded fetch calls to get gallery JSON data. By default Cloudinary only allows 10 API calls per tag name, so if I want to be able to fetch more than 10 galleries I will want to do so dynamically.

* Need to add more comments and clean up variable names so it's easier to follow

* Gallery titles only display when a user hovers over the thumbnail. It looks nice on desktop, but on mobile it needs to just display the title without hovering

* Getting some of the data from Cloudinary seemed to be very complicated. There is probably an easier way to make certain API calls, so I need to spend more time reading the documentation

## Features I Want to Add

* Randomly display the galleries

* Display more than 10 galleries

* Sort galleries by topic (Animals, trips, family, etc)
